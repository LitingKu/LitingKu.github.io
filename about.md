## RNA Analyses

This section will include the work and code I have learnt and done for bulk and single cell analyses

### Bulk RNA Analysis


- [RNA Sequence Analysis Preparation](https://github.com/LitingKu/RNA-Alterntaive-Splicing-Analyses.git)

- [Chromosome Analysis](https://github.com/LitingKu/Chromosome-Grid-Plot.git).  
This include the R function I written for generating the frequency table and chromosome grid plot for Human and Mouse.



### Single Cell Analysis
